*HOW TO* generate a tidy dataset that provides a calculated average of all std and mean data resulting from the merging of the training and test data that is collected in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset".

1. Get data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

2. Run the *run_analysis.R* r script (found in in this respository):
   run_analysis <- function(dataDir,outfile)
     where  dataDir is root of data from item 1, and outfile is desired path for resultant output
